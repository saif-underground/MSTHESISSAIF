\chapter{Customer Description} 

In this chapter I will describe the customers present in the PowerTAC simulation system, some statistics about them and their attributes.

\section{Customers}

In PowerTAC simulation system the customers are the entities that buys and sells energy. A customer subscribes to one of the tariffs of the brokers and it pays or sells energy according the tariff plan. A customer can represent a population size of one to several thousands. For example, customers that represent a Electric Vehicle represent only one person and the customers that represent a village usually have several thousand population. In PowerTAC environment there are 168 customers.

\section {PowerTypes}
A customer can have among powertype among some possibility. Powertype determines the behaviour of the customers. A customer that has powertype related to production produces energy. A customer that has a power type related to energy consumption usually consumes energy. In the following subsections I describe powertypes of the customer.

\subsection{consumption}

A customer with powertype consumption are the most common customers. They use the energy when they need it. They cannot shift their demand to a future timeslot. Usually they have a regular pattern in their energy usage. Usually they show similar pattern for weekdays. They have similar kind of usage pattern for the weekends. 

The figure  \ref{fig:2daysbrook} shows 2 days electricity usage of the BrookSideHomes customer. The pattern shows in a day, around at 10 am there is a growing need for electricity. During night after 10 pm the electricity consumption starts decreasing.

\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:2weekOffice} shows two weeks consumption of the downtown customer. The customer shows similar pattern for all weekdays. It also distinguishable energy usage during the weekends.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Interruptible Consumption}
Interruptible customers are smart enough to shift their energy demand in a timeslot where they can buy electricity in a reduced price. Because of this shifting capability, they don't show the regular usage pattern as the consumption customers do. Figure \ref{fig:2weekOffice} shows a controlloable customer's 2 days usage.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Thermal Storage}
Thermal storage customers shows weekly pattern in their energy usage. Their energy usage in a day depends very much on the energy they used in the last timeslot. Figure \ref{fig:day-thermal} and \ref{fig:thermal-week} shows a day and two week's energy usage of the thermal storage customer sf2.

\subsection{Solar Production}
Figure \ref{fig:solar-twoday} shows two day's and  figure \ref{{fig:solar-oneweek}} shows a week's energy produciton of the Solar Production customer of the customer SunnyHill solar production customer.

\subsection {Electric Vehicle}


\section{Statistics}
In this section I present some statistics on the customers available in the system. 

\subsection {Customer Vs PowerType}

In the figure \ref{fig:cust-pt} we can see the system has more customer with the power type electric vehicle than any other powertypes. This is because, the electric vehicle represents a population of size 1.

  \caption{Number of customers vs Powertype.}
  \label{fig:cust-pt}
\end{figure}


\subsection {Population Vs PowerType}
From figure \ref{fig:pop-pt} by far the powertype of consumption has the most number of people in them.

  \label{fig:pop-pt}
\end{figure}


\subsection {Total Energy Consumed Vs PowerType}
From figure \ref{fig:energy-pt} we can see that the consumption type customers uses the most amount of the electricity.
