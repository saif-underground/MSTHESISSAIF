\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my deep-felt gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Christopher Kiekintveld of the Computer Science Department at The University of Texas at El
Paso, for his constant support. I was very new to the research area, and found the early days very depressing. All my attempts to solve the problem were failed at the attempts of first six months. I gave up. But he did not give up on me. He set aside a time for weekly meeting to know my progress. He listened to my works and results. I found him a reliable person to share my research related as well as personal problem. If he was not there, I could not have finished the thesis. 

I also wish to thank the other members of my committee, Dr. Shahriar Hossain of 
the Computer Science Department and Dr. Paras Mandal of the Electrical Engineering 
Department, both at The University of Texas at El Paso.  Their suggestions, 
comments and additional guidance were invaluable to the completion of this work.

\newpage
Additionally, I want to thank The University of Texas at El Paso Computer 
Science Department professors and staff for all their hard work and dedication,
providing me the means to complete my degree and prepare for a career as a 
computer scientist. This includes (but certainly is not limited to) the 
following individuals:

\bigskip

\noindent
Dr. Olac Fuentes
\begin{quote}
 I worked with Dr. Fuentes as teaching assistant (TA) for the course algorithms and data structures. He made the TAs to attend the classes. I attened all his classes. I am very much influenced by his teaching. He is very detail oriented. He is strict at the same time supportive. The classes helped me learn the concepts related to algorithms and data structures. With his support, an extreme introvert like me was able to run the lab section for the course and was able to develop public relational skills. I express my deepest gratitude to him.

Oscar Veliz
\begin{quote}
  I am forever in debt to Oscar, my colleague in the IASRL lab. Though he is a busy PhD student, he found time to go through my initial and sloppy thesis draft. I found him very hard working, helpful and encouraging. He always had good suggestions for all my queries. I regret that I we did not have more conversation during my stay in the lab.
\end{quote}

\noindent
Dr. Ivan Gris
\begin{quote}
  Ivan is one of the smartest person I have ever seen. He is very practical and supportive. I received numerous suggestions and advices from him. I found him very reliable and hard working. His mere presence influences a crowd around him very positively. 
\end{quote}

\noindent
My Roommates
\begin{quote}
  I received tremendous amount of support from my two room mates Porag and Sunny. They were peaceful. Porag reviewed my draft thesis several times. I thank them for all the things they did to me.
\end{quote}



And finally, I must thank my dear wife for all her supports and understandings.
