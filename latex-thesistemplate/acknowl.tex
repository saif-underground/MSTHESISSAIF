\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

At first, I would like to thank advisor, Dr. Christopher Kiekintveld of the Computer Science Department for everything he has done for me. I was very new to the research area and found the early days quite depressing. All my attempts to solve the problem failed for the first six months. I gave up. But he did not give up on me. He set aside time for the weekly meeting to know my progress. He listened to my works and results. I found him a reliable person to share my research and personal issues. If he was not there, I could not have finished my thesis. 

I also want to thank my other committee members, Dr. Shahriar Hossain of 
the Computer Science Department and Dr. Paras Mandal of the Electrical Engineering Department. Their guidance and constructive criticism helped me improve my thesis.

Additionally, I want to thank the following persons individually for what they have done for me:

\bigskip

\noindent
Dr. Olac Fuentes
\begin{quote}
 I worked with Dr. Fuentes as teaching assistant (TA) for the course algorithms and data structures. He made the TAs to attend the classes. I attended all his classes. I am strongly influenced by his teaching. He is very detail oriented. He is strict at the same time supportive. The classes helped me learn the concepts related to algorithms and data structures. With his support, an extreme introvert like me was able to run the lab section for the course and was able to develop public relational skills. I express my deepest gratitude to him.

Oscar Veliz
\begin{quote}
  I am forever in debt to Oscar, my colleague in the IASRL lab. Though he is a busy PhD student, he found time to go through my initial and sloppy thesis draft. I found him very hard working, helpful and encouraging. He always had good suggestions for all my queries. I regret that I did not have more conversation during my stay in the lab.
\end{quote}

\noindent
Dr. Ivan Gris
\begin{quote}
  Ivan is one of the smartest persons I have ever seen. He is incredibly practical and supportive. I received numerous suggestions and advice from him. I found him very reliable and hard working. His mere presence positively influences a crowd around him. 
\end{quote}

\noindent
My Roommates
\begin{quote}
  I received a tremendous amount of support from my two roommates Porag and Sunny. They were peaceful. Porag reviewed my draft thesis several times. I thank them for all the things they did to me.
\end{quote}


And finally I want to thank my wife for giving me all the supports along the way.
